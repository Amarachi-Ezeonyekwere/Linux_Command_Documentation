##   Topic: Basic Linux Navigation Commands

Today, I focused on mastering **fundamental navigation commands** in Linux.  
These commands form the foundation for working confidently within the terminal.  
They allow you to explore directories, view files, check documentation, and review past commands efficiently.  

---

## 1. `pwd` ‚Äî *Print Working Directory*
The `pwd` command displays the **full path of the directory** you are currently working in.  
This is useful to avoid confusion, especially when moving between multiple directories.  

```bash
pwd
- Example Output:
/home/amarachi 
![pwd output](./Screenshots/pwd.png)

---

## 2. `ls` ‚Äî *List Directory Contents*
The ls command shows the files and directories in your current location.
It can be combined with different options for more detailed views:

```bash
ls        # Basic list of files 
ls -l     # Long format (permissions, size, ownership, timestamp)  ![ls-l output](./Screenshots/ls%20-l.png)
ls -a     # Show hidden files (those beginning with . )  ![ls -a output](./Screenshots/ls%20-a.png)

---

## 3. `cd` ‚Äî *Change Directory*
The cd command allows navigation between directories.

```bash
cd /etc     # Move into the /etc directory  ![cd etc output](./Screenshots/cd%20%20etc.png)
cd ..       # Go up one directory level  ![cd .. output](./Screenshots/cd%20...png)
cd ~        # Move to the home directory  ![cd ~ output](./Screenshots/cd%20~.png)
cd -        # takes you back to your previous directory.  ![cd output](./Screenshots/cd.png)

---

## 4.  `man` ‚Äî Manual Pages
The man command displays the manual/help pages for other commands.
It‚Äôs a powerful tool for self-learning directly in the terminal.

```bash
man ls  ![man ls output](./Screenshots/man%20ls.png)

Press q to exit the manual viewer.
Example: man ls will show detailed documentation about the ls command.

---

## 5.  `clear` ‚Äî *Clear the Terminal Screen*
The clear command removes clutter from your terminal screen, making it easier to focus.

```bash
clear ![clear output](./Screenshots/clear.png)![clear output](./Screenshots/clear2.png)

---

## 6. `history` ‚Äî *Command History*
The history command shows a list of previously executed commands.
This helps in recalling or reusing commands without retyping them.

```bash
history              # Show entire command history ![history](./Screenshots/history.png)
history | tail -n 5  # Show only the last 5 commands ![history | tail -n 5 output](./Screenshots/history%205.png)


##üìù Key Takeaways

- Navigation commands (pwd, ls, cd) are your map and compass in Linux.

- man is your built-in documentation tool ‚Äî use it often to deepen understanding at any time.

- clear helps with productivity, while history improves efficiency.

*These simple commands may seem basic, but they are the foundation for mastery in Linux system administration, cloud security, cloud computing, and DevOps*.
