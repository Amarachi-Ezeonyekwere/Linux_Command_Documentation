# 🐧 30 Days of Linux Challenge ## 
📌 About This repository documents my personal **30-day journey into Linux**. 
The challenge is for my career in **DevOps and Cloud Engineering**. 
I decided to learn Linux deeply because it is the foundation of: 
- System Administration
- Cloud Platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- DevOps Tools (Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD)
- Security & Networking
  
Each day, I focus on one concept, take notes, practice commands, and share screenshots as proof of learning. 

## 📂 Repository Structure Each folder represents a day in the challenge and contains: 
- 📝 **Markdown notes** (commands, explanations, and examples)
- 📸 **Screenshots** from my terminal practice
-  Example: 
Day 1/ → Introduction to Linux 
Day 2/ → Basic Navigation 
Day 3/ → File Structure
Day 4/ → Viewing Files
Day 5/ → Creating & Editing Files

Why This Challenge Matters:
This challenge is not just about Linux. It’s about *discipline, consistency, and building real-world skills* that form the backbone of a DevOps and Cloud Engineer.
